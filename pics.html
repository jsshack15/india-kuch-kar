<br>This garbage I found is near Mamoora mandi, & it is rotting. I & several other people  have to use this route daily, & find it really difficult!

<br>Hi I'm Anish! I reside in Sector 12 & found this mess near the stadium. Everyday people use this stadium for morning walks, cycling etc. but no one cares to clean this. I've written complaints to the RWA & authority as well, but no action is taken.
<br><br>

<br>I live in sector 31 & found this garbage near Golf Course metro station. Hope you guys will do the needful!

<br><h2>Then and now</h2>

<br>“When we first saw this mess, most of us thought that it will surely be a really tough job and require a lot of efforts. But after seeing the results, we feel that it was worth it!!” as quoted by one of the volunteers.

<br><br><br><img src="cap6.jpg" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
<br>A totally changed place is what it looked like after the efforts of our volunteers!!

<br><br><br><img src="cap7.jpg" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
<br>“WOW” is what everyone could say after seeing the transformation!

<br>
<br><br><h2>When they got caught red handed....</h2>

<br> This man was seen shifting his house’s garbage into his surroundings!

<br>Developed is what we call ourselves, though our actions say something else. 

<br><br><br><img src="cap3.jpg" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
<br>“I wasn’t the only one. Moreover, I wasn’t the one who started it. A pile of garbage was already there.” This is how we justify our deeds.

<br><br><br><img src="cap4.jpg" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
<br>Since it is not the city area, we believe that  these kinds of deeds are not questionable.
